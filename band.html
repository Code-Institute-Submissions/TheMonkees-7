                    <p>
                        <img src="assets/images/dj.jpg" alt="Davy Jones">From 1966 to 1971, Jones was a member of the
                        Monkees, a pop-rock group formed expressly for a television show of the same name. With Screen
                        Gems producing the series, Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as he was the only Monkee who
                        was signed to a deal with the studio, but still had to meet producers Bob Rafelson's and Bert
                        Schneider's standards. Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including
                        "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer". The DVD release of the first season of the show
                        contained commentary from the various bandmates. In Peter Tork's commentary, he stated that
                        Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely on playing
                        ability, it should have been Tork on guitar, Mike Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with
                        Micky Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork
                        on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Mostly playing tambourine or maracas, Jones filled in briefly for
                        Tork on bass when he played keyboards.

                        <img src="assets/images/md.jpg" alt="Micky Dolenz">In 1965, Dolenz was cast in the television
                        sitcom The Monkees and became the drummer and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show.
                        He was not actually a drummer and needed lessons even to be able to mime credibly, but
                        eventually was taught how to play properly. By the time The Monkees went on tour in late 1966,
                        Dolenz was competent enough to play the drums himself. He learned to play right-handed and
                        left-footed because of a leg disease called Perthes making his right leg weak.<br>Tommy Boyce
                        and
                        Bobby Hart, writers of many of The Monkees' songs, observed quickly that when
                        brought into the studio together, the four actors would try to make each other laugh. Because of
                        this, the writers often brought in each singer individually. The antics escalated until one time
                        Dolenz poured a cup of Coca-Cola on Don Kirshner's head; at the time, Dolenz did not know
                        Kirshner on sight.

                    <h2>Michael Nesmith</h2>
                    <p>
                        <img src="assets/images/mn.jpg" alt="Michael Nesmith">From 1965 to early 1970, Nesmith was a
                        member of the television pop-rock band The Monkees, created for the television situation comedy
                        of the same name. According to his May 2015 interview on Gilbert Gottfried's podcast, someone
                        showed him a copy of the famous press advertisement asking for "four insane boys" so he applied
                        for the job. Nesmith won his role largely by appearing blas√© when he auditioned. He rode his
                        motorcycle to the audition, and wore a wool hat to keep his hair out of his eyes; producers Bob
                        Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered "Wool Hat", and called Nesmith back.

                        Once he was cast, Screen Gems bought his songs so they could be used in the show. Many of the
                        songs Nesmith wrote for The Monkees, such as "The Girl I Knew Somewhere", "Mary, Mary" and
                        "Listen to the Band", became minor hits. One song he wrote, "You Just May Be the One", is in
                        mixed meter, interspersing 5/4 bars into an otherwise 4/4 structure.</p>

                    <h2>Peter Tork</h2>
                    <p>
                        <img src="assets/images/pt.jpg" alt="Peter Tork">Stephen Stills had auditioned for the new
                        television series about four pop-rock musicians but was turned down because the show's producers
                        felt his hair and teeth would not photograph well on camera. They asked Stills if he knew of
                        someone with a similar "open, Nordic look," and Stills suggested Tork audition for the part.
                        Tork got the job and became one of the four members of the Monkees, a fictitious pop band in the
                        mid-1960s, created for a television sitcom written about the fictitious band. Tork was the
                        oldest member of the group.

                        Tork was a proficient musician, and though the group was not allowed to play their own
                        instruments on their first two albums, he was an exception, playing what he described as "third
                        chair guitar" on Mike Nesmith's song, "Papa Gene's Blues," from their first album. He
                        subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their
                        recordings. He also co-wrote, along with Joey Richards, the closing theme song of the second
                        season of The Monkees, "For Pete's Sake".</p>
