# The Monkees - Official Website

This site made as my first Milestone project at Code Institue. The main goal was to create a responsive, user centric frontend website using the HTML5 and CSS3 technology.
On the website the user can navigate between the pages easily and they can use the website on every device as well thanks for the responsive design and implementation.

On the page we can find information about the band members, about the tour(where, when and how many ticket is available). We can listen some sample song and watch video clips on the Media site. We can send request for the band if We would like to invite them for a party. 
 
## UX
 
This website prepared for the fans of the Band and also those people who would like to get familiar with the Band music and schedule.
 
The Website is very colorful I use those kinds of colors that are simple and dominant in the Band life and those years where they were young in the 70's. 
 
I used the font awesome for the social link icons.

The two dominant font family is "Special Elite" and "ZCOOL KuaiLe".

## Technologies Used

    - Front End Framework for developing responsive websites 

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

I use local IDE for create the project called PyCharm. There is a built in deployment tools, so after I created a GitHub repository.



This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
