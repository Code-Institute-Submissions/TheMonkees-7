# The Monkees - Official Website

## About the Project:

This website made as my first Milestone project at Code Institue. The main goal was to create a responsive, user centric 
frontend website using the HTML5 and CSS3 technology.
On the website the user can navigate between the pages easily and they can use the website on every device as well thanks 
for the responsive design and implementation.

On the page we can find information about the band members, about the tour(where and when will be the next concerts. 
How many ticket is available). 
We can listen some sample song and watch video clips on the Media page. We can send request for the band if We would 
like to invite them for a party.

## UX
 
- This website prepared for the fans of the Band and also those people who would like to get familiar with the Band 
music and schedule.
- The Website is very colorful because these vivid colours connects to the band image. I use those kinds of colors that 
are simple and dominant in the Band life and those years where they were young in the 70's. 
- I used the "font awesome" font and icon toolkit for the social link icons.
- The two dominant font family is "Special Elite" and "ZCOOL KuaiLe" which are google fonts. I imported those fonts through 
the .css style file from the google fonts repository.
- Favicon (Shortcut icon) with "M" sign on every page.

- Phone and Tablet resolution
    - Usage on the different device resolutions like "Pixel 2" and "iPad"
- Console log error checking on every page during the testing

 - PC with HD resolution (with real usage)
 - Mobile Phones: 
    - Iphone SE
    - OnePlus 6T
    
Testing people:

- Myself

Test types:
- Manual tests
- Smoke tests on PC and Mobile
- Non-Functional tests (usability, reliability)

## Deployment

- **Set up**:
    - As my first step and as I use local IDE for create the project, I installed the Git locally and synchronized my local IDE 
    with the local git. I use Pycharm for the front end development and there is a helpful built in deployment tools. 
    After I created a Git and GitHub repository, I could start to work.
- **Commits**:
    - After every small piece and increment I made commit to my local Git repository. After that on the end of the 
    bigger section that gives value to my project I pushed my modification to my GitHub repository.
