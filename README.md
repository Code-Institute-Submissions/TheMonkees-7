# The Monkees - Official Website

This site made as my first Milestone project at Code Institue. The main goal was to create a responsive, user centric frontend website using the HTML5 and CSS3 technology.
On the website the user can navigate between the pages easily and they can use the website on every device as well thanks for the responsive design and implementation.

On the page we can find information about the band members about the tour(where, when and how many ticket is available). We can listen some sample song and watch video clips on the Media site. We can send request for the band if We would like to invite them for a party.

## User Stories



## UX
 
- This website prepared for the fans of the Band and also those people who would like to get familiar with the Band music and schedule.
- The Website is very colorful I use those kinds of colors that are simple and dominant in the Band life and those years where they were young in the 70's. 
- I used the font awesome for the social link icons.
- The two dominant font family is "Special Elite" and "ZCOOL KuaiLe". I imported those through the .css style file.
